# MyReads Project

This Web-App is created to help you with your book reading hobbies. You can use it like a virtual bookshelf in which you can add new books to one of the shelf or move books between shelves according to your need.

It maintains 3 shelves viz.
* Currently Reading: Books you have started reading.
* Want to Read / Wish list: Books you wish to read in future
* Read: Books you had read.

This app is hosted on [MyReads](https://my-reads-app-543.herokuapp.com/)

##  Note :
 This is my submission for the MyReads project at Udacity, part of the React Nano-degree.
